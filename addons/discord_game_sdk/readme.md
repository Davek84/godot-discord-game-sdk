# Godot-Discord-Game-SDK 🥏🎶

> **Godot Discord Game SDK integration using GDNative.** Supports 💰Windows, 🐧Linux & 🍏MacOS (x86_x64 only).

## Getting Started
1. Download the [example project](https://github.com/samsface/godot-discord-game-sdk/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
1. Download the Discord Game SDK following the offical [Discord Game SDK documenation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide) and extract any .so, .dll or .dylib files into the sample project's addons/discord_game_sdk directory.
3. Start the sample project! The Godot API is verbatim almost to the offical API so just follow the offical documenation.
